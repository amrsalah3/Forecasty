## Forecasty: Privacy Policy

Welcome to Forecasty app for Android, developed by Narify apps.

This is an open-source Android app developed by Amr Salah Abdelhady. The source code is available on GitHub and the app is also available on Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how bad it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge and permission.

#### Location Access:
The app collects the location of the phone via ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION to be able to precisely fetch weather forecast data for this location automatically.
The location information is sent to a server to get the weather forecast data for it.

#### Network State & Internet Access:
The app uses these permissions to access internet connection and the state of the networks:

- INTERNET: Used to access internet connection to be able to get/send location information and get weather forecast data to and from the server.

- ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, READ_PHONE_STATE: Used to determine WIFI and mobile cellular network status for the app to decide 
whether to update weather forecast data (network is connected) or display the last locally saved data.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by the app, or have any questions regarding how the app protects your privacy, please contact us:
